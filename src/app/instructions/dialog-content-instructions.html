  <p>Welcome to this HIT! In this HIT you can – depending on your decisions – earn money in addition to the X $ that you
    receive as a fixed payoff. It is thus very important that you read the instructions carefully. You will complete two
    stages. Each stage counts towards your final bonus payoff.</p>

  <p>During the HIT, we will not speak of Dollars, but Coins. Your entire payoff will first be calculated in Coins. The
    Coins you earn during the HIT will be converted to Dollars at the end of the HIT. The following conversion rate
    applies:</p>

  <p>1 Coin = X cents</p>

  <p>We will explain the exact procedure of the HIT on the next pages.</p>

  <p>To ensure that you have understood the instructions correctly, the main task does not begin until you have answered
    a few comprehension questions correctly. You will have a maximum of two attempts to answer all comprehension
    questions correctly.
    Throughout the whole task, all participants will remain anonymous.</p>
